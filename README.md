## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

By designing the code before writing it, I can ensure that the code is functional and secure. I can also ensure that the code is functional and secure by testing the code before releasing it to the public through static testing (manual review and automated ide checks) and dynamic testing (unit tests). Unit tests allow me to test for every edge case without deploying to a dedicated development or production environment.

## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I can interpret user needs by asking questions and listening to the user. I can incorporate user needs into a program by designing the program and creating tasks based on the feedback from the user. I can then use testing to make sure that the user's needs are satisifed by the program functionality.

## How do I approach designing software?

I can approach designing software by first designing the program and then writing the code after I am happy with the requirements that I and the users have set for the program. Consistent testing against user and company requirements and adaptation from the results can make the design better. Extensibility and performance are key to the success of the software and the design of the product should refect that.
